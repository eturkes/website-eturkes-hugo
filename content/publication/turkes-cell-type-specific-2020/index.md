abstract: 'Background: Region-specific neuronal subpopulations known to be selectively
  vulnerable to Tau pathology, as characterized in our previous work (Fu et al., 2019),
  were identified across several public single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets from
  non-diseased human in order to derive putative properties and mechanisms that drive
  vulnerability. Methods: We analyzed datasets from the Allen Brain Institute (Hodge
  et al., 2019), Broad Institute (Habib et al., 2017), and Polo group (Grubman et
  al., 2019). After QC, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, vulnerable and invulnerable
  neuronal subpopulations were identified using anatomical metadata and marker genes.
  Differential expression between subpopulations were performed using the Wilcoxon
  test, while differential pathway analysis was carried out using the GSVA algorithm.
  Result: We were able to identify putative subpopulations across a range of presumed
  vulnerability as defined by classical pathological staging. Several themes emerge
  from differential pathway analysis of these subpopulations in various comparisons,
  including those related to vesicle-mediated exocytosis activity and synaptic plasticity.
  Following further drilling down of these pathways for their association with vulnerability,
  pathways will be systematically screened in a model system measuring Tau aggregation.
  Conclusion: Extensive pathway analysis of neuronal subpopulations selectively vulnerable
  to Tau pathology in human single-nucleus RNA sequencing data reveal significant
  heterogeneity between neurons that may be responsible for driving pathological status.'
