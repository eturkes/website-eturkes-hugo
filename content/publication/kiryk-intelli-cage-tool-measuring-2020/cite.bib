 abstract = {Since the 1980s, we have witnessed the rapid development of genetically modified mouse models of human diseases. A large number of transgenic and knockout mice have been utilized in basic and applied research, including models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. To assess the biological function of mutated genes, modern techniques are critical to detect changes in behavioral phenotypes. We review the IntelliCage, a high-throughput system that is used for behavioral screening and detailed analyses of complex behaviors in mice. The IntelliCage was introduced almost two decades ago and has been used in over 150 studies to assess both spontaneous and cognitive behaviors. We present a critical analysis of experimental data that have been generated using this device.},
