abstract: Since the 1980s, we have witnessed the rapid development of genetically
  modified mouse models of human diseases. A large number of transgenic and knockout
  mice have been utilized in basic and applied research, including models of neurodegenerative
  and neuropsychiatric disorders. To assess the biological function of mutated genes,
  modern techniques are critical to detect changes in behavioral phenotypes. We review
  the IntelliCage, a high-throughput system that is used for behavioral screening
  and detailed analyses of complex behaviors in mice. The IntelliCage was introduced
  almost two decades ago and has been used in over 150 studies to assess both spontaneous
  and cognitive behaviors. We present a critical analysis of experimental data that
  have been generated using this device.
