I am a PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof. Karen E. Duff at University College London, investigating the basis of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's Disease using bioinformatic approaches.

As an undergraduate student at Boston University, I majored in neuroscience and helped analyze fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to further refine the DIVA model of speech. I followed this with a Master's degree from The University of Tokyo, where I focused on behavioral phenotyping of a novel mouse model of autism using Intellicage, an automated home cage system.

In my spare time, I am passionate about music, especially electric guitar. I also try to engage in community outreach with the support of Rotary International, and pursued my studies in Japan under a Rotary scholarship.
